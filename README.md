# Javascript tasks

Collection of core Javascript knowledge tests

The `src` folder contain the tasks and the tests.
Each task file contain:
- the explanation of the problem;
- what is desired as solution;
- the requirements;
- a simple boilerplate code;

Read carefully the problems, and the requirements.

In the `__tests__` folder, there is a correlated test for each task. 
* DO NOT DELETE the existing tests cases;
* DO NOT ALTER the folder's structure;
* You MUST make the existing test cases to pass as they are;
* FEEL FREE TO WRITE MORE TEST CASES if your see edge-cases that should be covered.

You can code your solution with any tool (Code editors/IDEs) of your preference.

### Requirements
